The code is written in C++ language. The code mines all fault-tolerant frequent itemsets using pattern growth approach. 

The user needs to provide the following four inputs to mine fault-tolerant frequent itemsets.



1. InputFile.txt

2. Minimum Item Support

3. Minimum Itemset Support

4. Fault-Tolerant Factor 




Given a transactional dataset (inputFile.txt), the user can mines all fault-tolerant frequent itemsets using following 5 input parameters.



How to run example =   ExecuteableFile	inputFile.txt	s1	outputFile.txt	s2	s3



s1 = Minimum Item Support

s2 = Minimum Itemset Support

s3 = Fault Tolerant Factor
